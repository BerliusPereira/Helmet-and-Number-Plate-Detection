The most widely used mode of transportation at the moment is two-wheelers. 
Although it is generally advised that bike riders wear helmets, this practise is frequently neglected globally, which results in collisions and fatalities. 
To address this issue, most countries have laws regulating the usage of helmets by two-wheeler riders. 
In addition to the law, a large portion of the police force issues fines for traffic offences in an effort to discourage this behaviour.
At the moment, this procedure is cumbersome and manual. 
This problem will be solved by the suggested technology, which will automatically detect drivers who are not wearing helmets. 
The system additionally extracts the licence plate. 
The procedure involves five steps: picture acquisition, basic processing, fringe detection and segmentation, feature extraction, and character number plate recognition using the relevant machine learning algorithms.
The technology makes use of image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify two-wheeler riders who are not wearing helmets. 
Using a video of traffic on a public road as its input, the system can identify moving items in a scene. 
An artificial intelligence classifier is used to assess whether the moving object is a two-wheeler. 
The licence plate is shown as the output in the event that the rider is not wearing a helmet.
